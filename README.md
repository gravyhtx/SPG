Super Password Generator v2.0

This is a random password generator based on a series of promts that determine requirements of creating a secure password.

To begin click on "let's go" and the user will encounter a series of prompts

The prompts are Boolean (true/false) statements for the variables:
    -  Lowercase letters
    -  Uppercase letters
    -  Numbers
    -  Symbols

The final prompt will query a number between 8-128 which will determine the character amount.

Arrays are set up for all possible options of each variable in which the character length will determine how many times it randomly chooses a value within the "true" arrays.

The final result will give the password based on the user requirements.

This process can be repeated as many times as user wishes by clicking "let's go" to generate a new secure password.
